- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


My initial impression of inheritance is that it is very convenient. Instead of creating an entirely new class, we can make a subclass of the superclass and simply modify the subclass. This allows us to create many similar classes more quickly, making the process much more efficient.

Something challenging in this assignment was learning how the hashtable works. It took me a while to know its methods and its functions. I was able to figure it out eventually. I would advice future students to start early on this assignment and go to the TA and office hours if they have questions.
